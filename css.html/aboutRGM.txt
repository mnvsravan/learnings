like RGB stands for red green and blue 
it is rep by rgb(number,number,number)
this number lies from 0 -255
we get colour cobination like yellow white etc and all by mixing these colours 
like if its (255,0,0) it is red and remaing etc
use color picker in google for better undersdtadning
similarly


we have HEX system 
it is represented by #ff0000 etc
here the ff are the 0-9 and letters from A-F 
LIKE RED IS #FF0000 etc 
and also the colours are excuted in order like if u keep style and css and again inline colour then the inline gets executed cuz its the latest ones
etc
