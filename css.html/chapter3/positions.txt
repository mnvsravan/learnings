1. static (default)

This is the default position for all elements.

Elements are placed in the normal document flow, one after another.

top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties do not work with static.

2. relative

The element remains in the normal flow, but you can shift it relative to its original position using top, right, bottom, left.

Space for the element is still preserved in the layout.

3. absolute

The element is removed from the normal flow.

Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with position: relative, absolute, or fixed).

If no ancestor is positioned, it’s positioned relative to the <html> (the page itself).

4. fixed

The element is removed from the flow.

Positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window), so it doesn’t move when scrolling.

Often used for sticky headers, menus, or floating buttons.

5. sticky

A mix of relative and fixed.

By default, it acts like relative.

But when you scroll and the element reaches a defined threshold (top, right, bottom, left), it “sticks” to that position (like fixed) until its parent container is scrolled out of view.
